# Board of Directors

The section is led by the board, which consists of 10 members elected by the section meeting. The board is, in addition to the section meeting, the section's highest decision-making body with responsibility for the section's activities and finances.

The board is the face of our section and we therefore have a lot of contact with our student union THS, the ITM school that is responsible for our program, KTH and other schools around Sweden.

The board meets several times a week and officially meets five times a year. Our meetings are open to everyone and section members are welcome to attend or raise issues with us.
