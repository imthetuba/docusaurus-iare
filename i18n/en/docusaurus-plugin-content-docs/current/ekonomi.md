### What is IK?

Ingenjörskapital or IK (formerly known as I Capital Management) has been running KTH's first student-run investment fund since 2014. IK has a major responsibility to manage the section's savings for long-term value growth and to promote interest in the investment process and stock analysis in the section. Here, students on the I program get the opportunity to participate as investment analysts and gain practical experience in valuation and investment assessment of various assets. IK regularly organizes events in the form of lectures and workshops together with other sections and companies.

### For students

As a student, do you have an interest in investments and want to learn more about fundamental analysis? During your time at Ingenjörskapital, you will learn the basics of investment valuation. You will also develop competence in stock analysis and presentation of investment pitches. The training sessions consisting of lectures and cases are held by board members from IK. The event is also held together with other sections and is combined with team building activities.

The idea is that the education should give students good knowledge in independently analyzing various assets so that they can then take an active role as managers in IK's investment fund. These experiences can be very valuable if the student wants to develop a career in finance. In addition, the program leads to a certificate for the students who complete all the elements.

### Collaborations with other sections and business

During the year, IK organizes together with partners various recruitment events such as lectures and company visits, often in combination with marketing and CV screening. If this sounds interesting, please contact us ordforande.ik@iare.nu
