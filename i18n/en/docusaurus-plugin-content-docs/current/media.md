# Communications Committee

KMN consists of four groups that ensure that the guild's communication and public face is as we want it to be. The first group is I-Focus, which photographs at events and does graphic design to preserve all the fun memories we create in the guild. The second group, I-T, maintains and updates the Guild's websites to facilitate Guild activity and provide easy access to important information. I-Nstagram is the third group and makes posts on social media so that the section can reach out to both section members and externally outside the section. Finally, the fourth group, I-Press, is responsible for the creation and launch of the section's own newspaper where committees and individual section members can write articles.
