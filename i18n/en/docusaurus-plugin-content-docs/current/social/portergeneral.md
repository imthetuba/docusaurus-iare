# Porter General

What is the Porter General?

The Porter General is a position of responsibility with three main responsibilities to the section. Firstly, it is the task of the Porter General to maintain, cherish and preserve the many traditions and ceremonies of the section as well as to develop new ones. Secondly, the Porter General is responsible for the guild's cultural symbols and regalia, such as ovaries, badges, medals, songbooks and not least the storage of Vintage Ports that are issued when the student graduates, if they manage to become worthy first... Thirdly, the Porter General represents the guild externally by, among other things, carrying the guild's flag in KTH's Fanborg.
