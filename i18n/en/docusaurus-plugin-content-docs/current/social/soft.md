# SOFt

### What is SOFt?

SOFt (Section Official Fixer Team) is not an ordinary committee, but rather a tool for the section and is the committee that maintains and protects the section's assets. Our goal is to create a pleasant environment for everyone in the guild! We do this primarily through maintenance of the section room Issy and the section car Volkis, but also different types of efforts to make the room a nicer place for all members by running creative projects and fixing things that need to be repaired or updated.

SOFt is the committee for those who are curious and open to solving problems and learning new things, while making sure that the section has a welcoming and pleasant place to gather!
